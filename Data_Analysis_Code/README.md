<h4>Data Analysis Code</h4>

This folder contains the data analysis code.

There are three seperate data analysis files, one for the image classification analysis, one for the time-series classification analysis and one that contains all other data analysis (manipulation-check, paired-sample t-test on mouse features and classification using mouse features).

You should be able to run the data analysis files with the datasets of this repository without changing the code.
