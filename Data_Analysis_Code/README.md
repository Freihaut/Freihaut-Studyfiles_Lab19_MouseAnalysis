<h4>Data Analysis Code</h4>

This folder contains the data analysis code.

There are three seperate data analysis files, one for the image classification analysis, one for the time-series classification analysis and one that contains all other data analysis (manipulation-check, paired-sample t-test on mouse features and classification using mouse features).

You should be able to run the data analysis files with the datasets of this repository without changing the code. The Data_Analysis_General.py file includes more than one analysis, but runs only one analysis at the time. In the beginning of the file you can find instructions on how to run the different analysis. It should only require to set the value of the analysis variable to the analysis procedure of your choice.
