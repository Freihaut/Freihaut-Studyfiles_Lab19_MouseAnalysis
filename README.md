# Repository for Study Material

<h3> General Information </h3>
This repository contains all materials, data and data analysis files used in a labratory study conducted 2019. The results of the study are documented in the research paper "Using the computer mouse for stress measurement – an empirical investigation and critical review" by Freihaut & Göritz, which will hopefully by published in the near future.
