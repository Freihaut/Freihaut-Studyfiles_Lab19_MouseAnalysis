<h4>Experimental Apps</h4>

This folder contains the experimental web application with which the study was conducted. The web application is a React web app that uses Firebase as a backend. The web application was only tested to work with recent versions of the Firefox and Chrome webbrowser. We recommend to only use those webbrowsers to view the app, because the app might behave differently in other webbrowsers. The app was optimized for a specfic screen size and is not responsive. You need a large enough screen to view and use the app properly. It is intented to work on a desktop computer with a keyboard and mouse as input devices and not on a tablet or smartphone with touch.

The experimental app is the original app used in the experiment and in German.

We additionally added another React web app in this folder, which contains a demo version of the tasks used in the study. This demo app is in English and can be tested live <a href=""> here </a>.
