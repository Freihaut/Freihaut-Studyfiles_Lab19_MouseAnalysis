<h4>Data Aggregation Code</h4>

This folder contains the data aggregation code which was used to create the aggregated datafiles from the raw data. This folder includes seperate files for (1) processing (1.1) the mouse data, (1.2) the heart data, (1.3) the eda data, (1.4) questionnaire data and (2) creating an aggregated dataset.

To use the files and create your own data sets for further analysis use Aggregated_Dataset_Creation.py in which all other preprocessing files are imported. In Aggregated_Dataset_Creation.py you can choose what data the final dataset should contain. Modify the other files in order to create other variables or change the data you want to use for further analysis (e.g. calculate additional mouse usage features or save the data in another format).
